Look, I was gonna go easy on you
Not to hurt your feelings
But I'm only going to get this one chance
Something's wrong, I can feel it
(Six minutes)
Just a feeling I've got
Like something's about to happen
But I don't know what
If that means what I think it means
We're in trouble, big trouble
And if he is as bananas as you say
I'm not taking any chances
You are just what the doc ordered
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough
