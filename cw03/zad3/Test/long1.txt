Earth, earth,
riding your merry-go-round
toward extinction,
right to the roots,
thickening the oceans like gravy,
festering in your caves,
you are becoming a latrine.
Your trees are twisted chairs.
Your flowers moan at their mirrors,
and cry for a sun that doesn't wear a mask.
Your clouds wear white,
trying to become nuns
and say novenas to the sky.
The sky is yellow with its jaundice,
and its veins spill into the rivers
where the fish kneel down
to swallow hair and goat's eyes.
All in all, I'd say,
the world is strangling.
And I, in my bed each night,
listen to my twenty shoes
converse about it.
And the moon,
under its dark hood,
falls out of the sky each night,
with its hungry red mouth
to suck at my scars.
Lavender smells
bright red pails.
Yellow roses and daffodils.
Weeping willow, jasmine and eucalyptus honeysuckles tall as the sky.
Vaporized my youth.
Crickets sang us to sleep every night,
my soul to keep.
Tall misty grass purple valleys lazy days passed.
Three of us scrambling running
for first embrace.
Protected by~
The patterns on her dress. The smell of lavender in her hugs.
It was her I also loved.
Lavender smells
bright red pails.
Sexless and ineffable are the shadows that move
behind dirt-caked windows in this little village,
as we move like storm-water over cobblestones,
between midnight avenues, bent with time and violence
and the oppressive weight of lost generations,
to a tiny park filled with wind-blasted flowers
that gather around cracked fountains
Amid the howling of lost dogs and distant sirens,
Michael throws water on his ashen face;
Carl-Alex sings to himself childish songs,
and Claudia sits on a graffiti-tortured wall
laughing through winding violet smoke
Ich hatt' einen Kameraden
It was the easy heroism of youth,
with its bloodied hands and smeared makeup,
abandoned cars, downed fences,
broken families, empty streetcars,
shrill guitars, and silent weeping
into filthy sheets, from these hollow hours
in the lives of our kameraden
She had a soldier nonetheless,
and I am sure she had many,
but this is a small price to pay
in a place where there is no love
because there is too much risk
a place of being without having
Foggy glasses
muffled breathes
masked for COVID
gloved hands
and mufflers
smothered by
layers upon layers.
I blaze my own trail
winter chill sends shrills down the spine.
O Hans Christian Andersen,
look I am your “little match girl!"
Too tired, too cold, about to freeze on the pavement!
Ah! A hot bowl of soup.
A crackling fireplace
visions of hypothermia
I behold.
