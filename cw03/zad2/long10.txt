When you said it was over
You shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart?
Ooh, I was so mad
I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware
Of a woman with a broken heart
Praying to a sky all black
Looking at the stars like they finna talk back
Looking at my phone like she finna call back
But last night I feel like probably ended all that
'Cause by now she woulda sent a text in all caps
Then another one tryna take all back
Saying fuck you, I miss you or I hate you so much
'Cause girls only say "hate you" to the guys they love
I know, I know, I know
The highs, the lows it comes it goes
You say "be real" I try, I don't
'Cause you take anything and just make it everything
Kept my phone on silent ever since you got a ring (Funny right?)
And I never cheated (I mean, maybe once, twice)
One time don't change everything
She ask why I don't feel the same, I'm still the same
She's still insane and now she's saying
When you said it was over
You shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart?
Ooh, I was so mad
I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware
Of a woman with a broken heart
Okay, skeet, smoke, sleep, call
Miss, text, woke, spoke
Lie, feel, Lisa ew, time, kill, months, still
I got somebody baby mama calling me daddy (Yup)
I drank too much, please call me a cabby (Swerve)
Penthouse afterparty, hoes want that addy (Swerve)
Fuck they can ride with us, crawl in a Caddy
Third row is when you call, I hit cancel
Really? I hit answer, fuck I hate when that happens
Phone in my pocket for the whole night
And you heard bitches screamin' 'til my phone dies
Then she text me like, why you still talk to my mama?
How the fuck you run around with condoms?
Why you make me get this tattoo?
Man, fuck this tattoo you the reason I wasn't single in college
What? All because I had you
Nigga I dont even have you
How am I suppose to get past you?
And she called the next guy spillin' some real shit
Now they problems he got to deal with
When you said it was over
You shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart?
Ooh, I was so mad
I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware
Of a woman with a broken heart
Girl, don't believe them hoes
'Cause they don't wanna see us together
And you already know you're too fly
But baby, don't get your hair caught in the propellers
I be tryna tell her these hoes is jealous
You know they never like it when you never say never
Long hair, red bone, but her pussy is hairless
Mwah, I french kiss it like we in Paris
I be screaming out, ain't no woman like the one I got
But she be always worrying about the one I fucked
She said it's gonna be me, myself and I
Damn, that would make me a one-eyed fuck
I was so mad
Damn, you used to ride a nigga like a moped
But players fuck up, my bad
And just to keep from crying, I laughed
When you said it was over
You shot right through my heart (Tunechi)
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart?
Ooh, I was so mad
I should've seen this coming right from the start (Damn)
You should beware, beware, beware
Of a woman with a broken heart
Baby, last time calling me baby
Last time calling me crazy, crazy, crazy
Baby, last time calling me baby
Last time calling me crazy, crazy, crazy
When you said it was over
You shot right through my heart
